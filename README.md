EDA Tools by ShortLink AB.

ShortLink is a competence center with a focus on the development of low-power electronics for wireless communication and portable products. We develop ASICs, Silicon IP, embedded hardware and software. On behalf of our customers, and with over 20 years of experience, we develop the most optimal solutions for each individual assignment.

Most of our development is protected under various contracts and NDAs, but we occationaly develop scripts or smaller pieces of software not subject to these limitations. We have decided to see if it makes sense to publish these as open source.

This reposity is intended for scripts and tools related to EDA (electronic design automation). These are typically developed for a highly specific purpose or to solve a particular problem. We hope that the code can be useful for others as well.

Please let us know if you have any feedback or comments!
